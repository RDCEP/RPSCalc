In 2004, voters approved Amendment 37 requiring utilities serving 40,000 or more customers to generate or purchase enough renewable energy to comprise 10% of retail electric sales. It would be increased and modified two subsequent times to its current 20%. In 2013, a distributed generation carve-out was added, and coal methane gas and municipal solid waste became eligible technologies (subject to Public Utilities Commission's approval). The same bill--S.B. 252--created a separate RPS schedule for coops, requiring 20% of sales from renewables by 2020 and thereafter.",
