  Texas’s RPS is capacity-based, meaning utilities must install 10,000 MW
  of renewable capacity by 2025, rather than a percentage of sales. There
  is a ‘trajectory’ of annual requirements leading up to the end-goal;
  however, it is not pictured here because it is not a percentage. Try
  creating a trajectory by entering your own values, keeping in mind the
  choices you make about the trajectory will affect the overall cost of
  your policy.
