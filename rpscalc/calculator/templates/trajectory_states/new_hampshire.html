  New Hampshire’s RPS is split up into four ‘Classes’ with separate
  trajectories, which together make up the overall goal of 24.8% of
  retail electric sales from renewable energy by 2025 (subject to the legally
  defined <a href={{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#cost_cap">cost cap</a>).
  Class I comprises the majority of the RPS at 15% of the annual requirement
  by 2025.
