  Colorado has two RPS schedules: a primary applying to
  investor-owned utilities (pictured below), and a secondary
  applying to municipal utilities and co-ops. Both follow a step
  pattern ‘ramp-up’, where 2–3 years might have the same
  percentage requirement (rather than a gradual yearly increase).
  The primary RPS requirement is three times larger than the
  secondary, at 30% by 2020. You are free to adjust this policy,
  but keep in mind the choices you make about the trajectory will
  affect the overall cost of your policy.
