  Iowaâ€™s RPS is capacity-based, meaning it required the state's retail
  electric providers to procure 105 MW from renewable sources. There is no
  set trajectory, as the goal did not increase. Try creating a trajectory
  by entering your own values, keeping in mind the choices you make about
  the trajectory will affect the overall cost of your policy.
