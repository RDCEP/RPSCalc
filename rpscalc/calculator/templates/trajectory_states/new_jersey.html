  New Jersey’s RPS is split up into two ‘Classes’ with separate
  trajectories, which together make up the overall goal of 20.38% of
  retail electric sales from renewable energy by 202 (subject to the legally
  defined <a href={{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#cost_cap">cost cap</a>).
  17.88% of retail sales must come from Class I (solar, wind, tidal and
  geothermal) by 2020/21, and 2.5% from Class II (hydroelectricity).
