  New Jersey allows recoverable <a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#acp">alternative
  compliance payments (ACPs)</a>, which sets an effective ceiling on
  the premium a utility will be willing to pay for renewable energy.
  If the renewable energy premium exceeds this ceiling, the utility would
  prefer to meet the standard by making the lower cost alternative
  compliance payments.</p><p>The state also includes a special ACP that
  applies only to stateâ€™s solar carve-out. If the cost of meeting this
  carve-out is higher than the cost of a solar ACP, we assume utilities
  will choose the cost-minimizing option and pay the ACP, thus freezing
  the RPS carve out in that period, but not the general RPS. Similarly,
  if the cost of meeting the general RPS, but not the carve-out specifically,
  exceeds the ACP, we assume utilities will pay the ACP for all non-carve
  out technologies, but continue to comply with the carve out as long as
  it remains below the carve out ACP.
