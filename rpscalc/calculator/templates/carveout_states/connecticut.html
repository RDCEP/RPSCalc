  Connecticut’s carve-out is for a ‘class’ that consists of a group
  of technologies. Up to 3% of the annual RPS requirement can come
  from Class II resources, which include waste, biomass, and hydro.
  Because the RPS calculator currently supports carve-outs for only
  wind and solar power, you can try experimenting with these technology
  requirements by adding values to the graph below.
