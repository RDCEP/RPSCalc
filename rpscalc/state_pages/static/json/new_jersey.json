This goal is divided into  two portions: Class I (including solar, wind, tidal and geothermal) and Class II (including  hydroelectricity) renewable energy. 17.88% of retail sales must come from Class I by 2020/21  and 2.5% from Class II.

This established 'penalty' acts as a cost cap. A more conventional cost cap exists  for the solar carve-out. This technology requirement is frozen if the price of solar exceeds a 2% increase over the retail rate. \nEstimate how New Jersey's cost cap can effect their RPS's efficacy\n"
