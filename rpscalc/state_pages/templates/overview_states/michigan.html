  <p>Michigan's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) establishes a minimum amount of renewable energy that must be sold by the state's electricity providers. This page identifies and describes the features of the RPS and how they work together to define the minimum amount of renewable energy that will be sold in Michigan.</p>

{% block state_statute %}
  <p>Michigan's RPS was enacted by <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2007-2008/publicact/pdf/2008-PA-0295.pdf">Public Act 295</a> in October 2008. In total, this act will require that electric providers in Michigan produce 10% of their energy from renewable sources by 2015. The first compliance period began in 2012. The annual requirements are determined for each utility based on statutorily defined increments between 2007 baseline and the 2015 goal. In addition to these percentage requirements (which can be fulfilled through REC purchases), large utilities have additional capacity requirements.</p>
