  <p>Michigan’s Renewable Energy Standard (RES)—also known as a
    <a href={{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#rps">Renewable Portfolio
    Standard (RPS)</a>—establishes a minimum amount of renewable energy
    that must be sold by the state’s electricity providers. This page
    identifies and describes the features of the RPS and how they work
    together to define the minimum amount of renewable energy that will be
    sold in Michigan. The state also established a separate Energy Efficiency
    Resource Standard (EERS) requiring 1% annual savings over the previous
    year by 2012 and thereafter, but these are not considered for
    calculations on this and subsequent pages.</p>

{% block state_statute %}
  <p>Michigan’s RPS was enacted by
    <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2007-2008/publicact/pdf/2008-PA-0295.pdf">Public
    Act 295</a> in October 2008. In total, this act will require that electric
    providers in Michigan produce 10% of their energy from renewable sources
    by 2015, with the first compliance period beginning in 2012. The annual
    requirements are determined for each utility based on statutorily defined
    increments between 2007 baseline and the 2015 goal. In addition to these
    percentage requirements (which can be fulfilled through REC purchases),
    large utilities have additional capacity requirements of up to 600 MW
    by 2015, based on the size of the customer base.</p>
