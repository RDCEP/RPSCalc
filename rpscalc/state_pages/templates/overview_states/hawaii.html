  <p>Hawai‘i’s <a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#rps">Renewable
    Portfolio Standard (RPS)</a> is intended to increase use of renewable
    resources in the state by establishing the minimum amount of
    renewable energy that the state’s electricity providers must sell
    in a given year. This legally-established renewable energy
    procurement goal gradually increases over time to meet the overall
    target of 40% renewable power by 2030. The state also established
    separate Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standards (EEPS) requiring
    4,300 GWh reduction by 2030, but these are not considered for
    calculations on this and subsequent pages.</p>
  <p>The state profile below
    explores the design of this policy, highlighting the factors that
    influence the success of Hawaii’s RPS goals and the tradeoffs
    inherent to it. Once you’re comfortable with the information on this
    page, you can evaluate the policy’s expected viability with the
    <a href="{{ url_for('calculator.trajectory', state=state) }}">RPS
    Feasibility Calculator</a>. You can also use the calculator to
    change the policy requirements, trajectory, cost cap, and more, to
    see how altering Hawai‘i’s policy design affects its success.</p>

  <p><a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#carveout">Carve-outs</a>
    can create economic opportunities in the state by introducing new or
    promising technologies into the market. However, these standards
    limit the utilities’ ability to substitute between renewable energy
    sources, potentially increasing the cost of the policy. Hawai‘i does
    not require any technology carve-outs.</p>
{% endblock %}
{% block state_costcap %}
  <p>Unlike some states, Hawai‘i does not have an explicit
    <a href=”http://rps.obstructures.org/glossary#cost_cap”>‘cost cap’</a>
    or limit on the potential increase in electricity costs as a result
    of this policy. However, the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) may
    waive compliance with the RPS program for good cause. A 2009
    <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2009/bills/HB1464_CD1_.htm">amendment</a>
    states that starting in 2013, the RPS is to be evaluated every 5 years
    for achievability. The PUC may revise standards based on best
    information available at the time. This process also applies to the
    EEPS. Using the <a href="{{ url_for('calculator.trajectory', state=state) }}">RPS
    Feasibility Calculator</a> you can act as the PUC and define an
    explicit cost cap, determining what level of costs will lead to a
    viable RPS.</p>

{% block state_statute %}
  <p>Hawai‘i is the only state to create a complementary ‘energy efficiency
    RPS’ called the Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standards (EEPS),
    calling for a 30% decrease in energy consumption (or 4,300 GWh)
    in addition to the RPS. The general
    <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/hrscurrent/Vol05_Ch0261-0319/HRS0269/HRS_0269-0092.htm">RPS
    statute</a> calls for 40% of electricity from renewable energy by
    2030, the highest RPS goal in the country. The Public Utilities
    Commission (PUC) can designate specific portions of the goal to each
    utility, and sometimes may specify a renewable technology to meet
    the goal. Until 2015, energy efficiency measures will count toward
    the total RPS requirements; after 2015, 100% of the requirements must
    be met through renewable electricity.</p>
