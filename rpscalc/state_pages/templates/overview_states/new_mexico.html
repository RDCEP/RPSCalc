{% block state_summary %}
  <p>New Mexico’s <a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#rps">Renewable
    Portfolio Standard (RPS)</a> is intended to increase use of renewable
    resources in the state by establishing the minimum amount of renewable
    energy that the state’s electricity providers must sell in a given
    year. This legally-established renewable energy procurement goal
    gradually increases over time to meet the overall target of 20% renewable
    power by 2020.</p>
{% endblock %}
{% block state_overview %}
  <li><b>20%</b> of the state's energy consumption must be from renewable
    sources by <b>2020</b>, subject to the cost cap</li>
  <li>Carve-out for <b>solar</b>, <b>wind</b>, <b>distributed generation</b>,
    other non-wind non-solar technologies</li>
  <li>Explicit cost cap at <b>3%</b> of annual revenue</li>
{% endblock %}
{% block state_carveouts %}
  New Mexico has a diverse system of four technology requirements that
  begin in 2011; more than half of the REA is comprised of carve-outs.
  Together, wind and solar make up 50% of the annual REA requirements.
  See the statute table below for addiontal details.
{% endblock %}
{% block state_costcap %}
  <p>New Mexico has an explicit <a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#cost_cap">‘cost
    cap’</a>. known as reasonable cost thresholds (RCTs) in
    <a href="http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/NMAC/parts/title17/17.009.0572.htm">NMAC
    17.9.572.12</a> to protect the consumer from price increases due to REA
    compliance. Public utilities will not be required to add renewable energy
    to their portfolio if the costs of doing so exceeds 3% of total yearly
    revenue.</p>

{% block state_statute %}
  <p>New Mexico’s <a href="http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/NMAC/parts/title17/17.009.0572.htm">Renewable
    Energy Act (REA)</a> has two schedules overseen by the Public Regulation
    Commission (PRC); a primary RPS for investor-owned utilities starting
    in 2006, requiring 20% of total retail sales to New Mexico customers be
    from renewable energy by 2020. A secondary RPS applies to rural electric
    cooperatives requiring 10% by 2020. All of the defined carve-outs apply
    to the primary RPS only, and in 2013 the wind carve-out was increased
    from 20 to 30%.</p>

{% block state_eligible_tech %}
  Solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower facilities (post 2007), fuel cells
  using non-fossil fuel, and various biomass resources (such as: agriculture
  or animal waste, small diameter timber, salt cedar and other phreatophyte
  or woody vegetation removed from river basins or watersheds in New Mexico,
  landfill gas and anaerobically digested waste biomass)
{% endblock %}
{% block state_geo_eligible %}
  Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) may be used for compliance, but must be
  contracted for delivery, consumed, or generated by an end-use customer
  in New Mexico, unless determined otherwise by the PRC
{% endblock %}
{% block state_total_load %}
  Primary RPS: 67.7%, Secondary RPS: 20.8%
{% endblock %}
{% block state_tech_req %}
  Carve-outs only apply to IOUs: Wind—30% of annual req.; Solar—20%
  annual req.; Geothermal, hydro (post 2007), and other renewables—5% annual
  req. starting in 2011; Distributed Generation—1.5% annual req. by 2011,
  3% by 2015
