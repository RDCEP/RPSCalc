  <p>Nevada’s <a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#rps">Renewable
    Portfolio Standard (RPS)</a> is intended to increase use of renewable
    resources in the state by establishing the minimum amount of
    renewable energy that the state's electricity providers must sell
    in a given year. This legally-established renewable energy
    procurement goal gradually increases over time to meet the overall
    target of 25% renewable power by 2025. New energy efficiency measures
    also count toward the goal, which are discussed but not considered
    for calculations on this and subsequent pages.</p>
  <p>The state profile below explores the design of this policy,
    highlighting the factors that influence the success of Nevada’s
    RPS goals and the tradeoffs inherent to it. Once you’re comfortable
    with the information on this page, you can evaluate the
    policy’s expected viability with the
    <a href="{{ url_for('calculator.trajectory', state=state) }}">RPS
    Feasibility Calculator</a>. You can also use the calculator to
    change the policy requirements, trajectory, cost cap, and more,
    to see how altering Nevada's policy design affects its success.</p>

    can create economic opportunities in the state by introducing new or
    promising technologies into the market. However, these standards limit
    the utilities’ ability to substitute between renewable energy sources,
    potentially increasing the cost of the policy. Nevada requires 5% of
    the annual RPS requirement must be fulfilled with solar power by 2015,
    or 1.2% of total sales in that year. For the period 2016 to 2025,
    it rises to 6% of generation, 1.5% of sales in 2025.</p>

{% block state_progress %}
  <p>Compare the goal established in the RPS to what is being achieved.
    The most current information available is from 2011. As of 2011
    Nevada was 100% compliant with its goal of 15% capacity in that year,
    leading to a goal of 25% capacity in 2025.</p>
{% endblock %}
{% block state_costcap %}
  <p>Unlike some states, Nevada does not have an explicit
    <a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#cost_cap">‘cost&nbsp;cap’</a>
    or limit on the potential increase in electricity costs as a result of
    this policy. However, all new contracts must be approved by the PUC.
    If insufficient supply is available at ‘just and reasonable’ terms
    (as determined by the PUC), then the PUC may choose to exempt the
    provider from any remaining RPS requirements. Using the
    <a href="{{ url_for('calculator.trajectory', state=state) }}">RPS
    Feasibility Calculator</a> you can act as the PUC and define an explicit
    cost cap, determining what level of costs will lead to a viable RPS.</p>

{% block state_statute %}
  <p>Nevada’s original RPS was established in 1997, and was most recently
    updated in 2009 (<a href="http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Nrs/NRS-704.html#NRS704Sec7801"
                        target="_blank">NRS 704.7801</a>).
    It applies to investor-owned utilities and retail suppliers,
    requiring 25% of retail sales from renewable sources by 2025.
    New energy efficiency measures also count toward the goal. Nevada
    statute requires the retirement of 800 MW of coal plants, to be
    replaced with cleaner sources (including at minimum 350 MW from
    renewable sources). The RPS is administered by the <a href="http://puc.nv.gov/"
