  <p>Rhode Island's Renewable Portfolio Standard (actually called Renewable Energy Standard or RES) establishes a minimum amount of renewable energy generation capacity that must be acquired by state electric utilities. This page identifies and describes the features of the RES and how they work together to define the minimum amount of renewable energy that will be sold in Rhode Island.</p>

{% block state_carveouts %}
  <p>Rhode Island's RES does not have any minimum technology requirements. However, RI's Long-Term Contracting Standard for Renewable Energy (2009) establishes a <i>de facto</i> carve-out for in-state solar (3 MW capacity per utility by 2014). <a href="http://sos.ri.gov/documents/archives/regdocs/released/pdf/PUC/5933.pdf">Rules</a> established by RI's PUC.</p>
{% endblock %}
{% block state_costcap %}
  <p>Electricity distribution companies in Rhode Island can recover all costs incurred by complying with the RES. They not recover costs associated with penalties for non-compliance. (See RES Rules 8.4) Rhode Island's 'Long-Term Contracting Standards for Renewable Energy' does include a cost-cap. To maintain compliance with that law, utilities only have to enter long-term contracts when they are deemed 'comercially reasonable' by the PUC.</p>

{% block state_statute %}
  <p>Established in 2004, with compliance required beginning in 2007, Rhode Island's Renewable Energy Standard requires that all obligated utilities procure 16% of retail electric sales from renewable sources by 2020. The maximum amount of existing renewable resources that can be applied to compliance with the standard is capped at 2.0% of total retail sales. This law is administered by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Comission. In a seperate 2009 law (<a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE39/39-26.1/39-26.1-1.HTM">Long-term Contracting Standard for Renewable Energy</a>) electric distribution companies will be required to enter into long-term contracts with new renewable energy facilities totaling 90 MW of capacity by 2014 (of which 3 MW must be from in-state solar).</p>
