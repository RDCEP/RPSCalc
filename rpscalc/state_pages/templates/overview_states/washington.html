  <p>Washington’s <a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#rps">Renewable
    Portfolio Standard (RPS)</a> is intended to increase use of renewable
    resources in the state by establishing the minimum amount of renewable
    energy that the state’s electricity providers must sell in a given year.
    This legally-established renewable energy procurement goal gradually
    increases over time to meet the overall target of 15% renewable power by
    2020.</p>
  <p>The state profile below explores the design of this policy,
    highlighting the factors that influence the success of Washington’s RPS
    goals and the trade-offs inherent to it. Once you’re comfortable with the
    information on this page, you can evaluate the policy’s expected
    viability with the <a href="{{ url_for('calculator.trajectory', state=state) }}">RPS
    Feasibility Calculator</a>. You can also use the calculator to
    change the policy requirements, trajectory, cost cap, and more, to see
    how altering Washington’s policy design affects its success.</p>

    can create economic opportunities in the state by introducing new
    or promising technologies into the market. However, these standards
    limit the utilities’ ability to substitute between renewable energy
    sources, potentially increasing the cost of the policy. Washington’s
    RPS does not require specific technologies to meet its annual
    renewable obligations.</p>
{% endblock %}
{% block state_costcap %}
  <p>Washington does not have an explicit cost cap. However, by allowing
    <a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#acp">alternative
    compliance payments (ACPs)</a>, Washington sets an effective cap on
    the premium a utility will be willing to pay for renewable energy.
    The RPS set this cap in 2007 at $50/MWh, which is adjusted annually
    for inflation (see <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.285.060" target=”_blank”>RCW
    19.285.060</a>). If the renewable energy premium exceeds this cap,
    the utility would prefer to meet the standard by making the lower-cost
    alternative compliance payments. Using the
    <a href="{{ url_for('calculator.trajectory', state=state) }}">RPS
    Feasibility Calculator</a> you can make adjustments to cost of
    alternative compliance, determining how this impacts the provision of
    renewable power and the overall viability of the RPS.</p>

{% block state_statute %}
  <p>Washington's RPS was enacted in 2006, and required any utility
    serving more than 25,000 to obtain 15% of its electricity from
    renewable sources by 2020
    (<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.285.040" target=”_blank”>RCW
    19.285.040</a>) or spend at least four percent of its annual retail
    revenue on renewable energy premiums
    (<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.285.050" target=”_blank”>RCW
    19.285.050</a>). Utilities can recover all ‘prudent’ costs from
    rate-payers (this includes spending beyond 4% of revenue, which is
    why it does not affect the cost cap). In addition, the state requires
    utilities subject to the RPS to pursue all energy conservation that
    is cost-effective by January 2010. They must identify achievable
    potential through 2019, with reviews and updates every two
    years for ten years.</p>

  A qualifying utility that fails to comply with the conservation or
