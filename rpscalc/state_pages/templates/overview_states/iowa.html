  <p>Iowa’s Alternative Energy Law (AEL)—also known as a
    <a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#rps">Renewable Portfolio
    Standard (RPS)</a>—is intended to increase use of renewable resources
    in the state by establishing the minimum amount of renewable energy
    that the state’s electricity providers must sell in a given year.
    This legally-established renewable energy procurement goal is set
    at an overall target of 105MW of renewable power.</p>

  <p>Unlike some states, Iowa does not have an explicit
    <a href="{{ url_for('glossary.glossary') }}#cost_cap">‘cost cap’</a>
    or limit on the potential increase in electricity costs as a result
    of this policy. Using the <a href="{{ url_for('calculator.trajectory', state=state) }}">RPS
    Feasibility Calculator</a> you can act as the Public Utilities
    Commission and define an explicit cost cap, determining what level
    of costs will lead to a viable RPS.</p>

  <p>The Iowa Alternative Energy Law
    (<a href="http://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&service=IowaCode&ga=83&input=476.41"
        target="_blank">§ 476.41</a>) is a capacity-based standard,
    which requires its investor-owned utilities to own or contract a total
    of 105 MW of renewable energy. It is split between MidAmerican Energy
    (55.2 MW, or 52.57% of demand) and Alliant Energy Interstate Power
    and Light (49.8 MW, or 47.43% of demand). There are no mandated
    increases, and the target has already been achieved.</p>
