  <p>Maryland's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) establishes a minimum amount of renewable energy that must be sold by the state's electricity providers. This page identifies and describes the features of the RPS and how they work together to define the minimum amount of renewable energy that will be sold in Maryland.</p>

  <li><strong>20%</strong> of the state's energy consumption must be from renewable sources by <strong>2022</strong></li>
  <li>Carve-outs for <strong>solar</strong> and <strong>off-shore wind</strong></li>
  <li>Cost cap at $1.50 over current average monthly bill or 1.5% over total electric bills</li>

{% block state_carveouts %}
  <p>Maryland's  solar technology requirement provides a small portion of the annual requirement. A new standard for offshore wind places a maximum at 2.5% of retail, but the schedule for implementation is yet to be determined. The chart below is a breakdown for the primary RPS for IOUs. Offshore wind has been excluded due to the lack of current schedule.</p>

{% block state_costcap %}
  <p>The total cost of additional renewable energy under the RPS cannot exceed $1.50 on the 'average' customer's monthly bill</p>
{% endblock %}
{% block state_statute %}
  <p>Maryland's current RPS was originally enacted in 2004 and has since been ammended multiple times. Most recently Maryland's RPS was updated to add a carve-out for offshore wind. The implementation of this carve-out is yet to be determined. Currently, statute requires that 20% of the state's retail electric sales come from renewable sources by 2022. Each general annual requirement (until 2019) is divided into two tiers of generation. This policy is currently administered by the Maryland Public Service Commission (http://webapp.psc.state.md.us/intranet/ElectricInfo/home_new.cfm). </p>
