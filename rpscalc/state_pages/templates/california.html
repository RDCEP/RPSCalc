  <p>California's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) establishes a minimum amount of renewable energy that must be sold by the state's electricity providers. This page identifies and describes the features of the RPS and how they work together to define the minimum amount of renewable energy that will be sold in California.</p>

  <li><strong>33%</strong> of the state's energy consumption must be from renewable sources by <strong>2020</strong> subject to the cost cap</li>
  <li><strong>No</strong> carve-outs or technology requirements</li>
  <li><strong>No</strong> explicit cost cap</li>
  <li>Enacted 2002—one of the <strong>first</strong> and most aggresive in the country</li>

{% block state_carveouts %}
  <p>California does not have any minimum technology requirements at this time.</p>

{% block state_costcap %}
  <p>Retailers are required to meet renewable targets provided that sufficient funds are available in the state's 'virtual' fund designed to cover just and reasonable above market costs for new renewable energy resources. If funds are insufficient to cover procurement of renewable power, retailers are allowed to limit their annual procurement obligation. Estimate how California's cost cap can effect their RPS's efficacy</p>

  <p>Established in 2002, California's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) was last updated in April 2011. <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sbx1_2_bill_20110412_chaptered.html">This law</a> requires all electricity retailers in the state acheive the goal of 33% of retail sales from renewables by 2020. The RPS program is administered in tandem by the <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/portfolio/base_page.html">California Energy Commission</a> and the <a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/Renewables/overview">California Public Utilities Commission</a>.</p>

{% block state_geo_eligible %}
  As of 2011 limited trading of RECs produced in the 14 states and two Canadian provinces of the Western Electricity Coordiniating Council (WECC) can count towards a utilities RPS requirement. Up to 25% of a utilities requirements can be accounted for through eligible RECs for the compliance period ending in 2013, 15% for the compliance period ending in 2016 and 10% thereafter.
