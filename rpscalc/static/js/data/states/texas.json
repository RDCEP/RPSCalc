    "statute": "The current RPS was enacted in 2005 by S.B 20, which revised the original RPS mandate for Texas created by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) in 1999. In both cases, the purpose was to develop electricity procurement plans for renewable power. The current S.B 20 legislation more specifically: 5,880 MW (roughly 5% of Texas' electricity demand) of renewable power annually by 2015 and 10,000 MW by 2025. Since wind power accounts for nearly all of the current renewable energy generation in Texas, S.B 20 created a target of 500 MW of renewable-energy generation from resources other than wind. Renewable energy may be bundled with RECs.",

The cost cap is set at 'the greater of an additional 0.5% of the amount paid per kWh during the year ending in 2010, or 2% of the amount paid per kWh during the year ending May, 2007.' If exceeded, RPS requirements are placed under a 'freeze.'
