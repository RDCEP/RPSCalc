The RPS itself calls for 40% of electricity from renewable energy by 2030, the highest RPS goal in the country. The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) can designate specific portions of the goal to each utility, and sometimes may specify a renewable technology to meet the goal. Until 2015, energy efficiency measures will count toward the total RPS requirements; after 2015, 100% of the requirements must be met through renewable electricity.",
