At the time of the 1999 mandate, renewable capacity exceeded the 30% requirement. The purpose of the later revisions to the requirement have been to develop electricity procurement plans for renewable power beyond the existing capacity. The current legislation more specifically: an additional 10% of capacity to total 40% of renewable power annually by 2017. Renewable energy may be bundled with GIS certificates, which are similar to RECs, to meet Class I requirements, but not Class II requirements.",
