The bill also sets out that municipal utilities and electric cooperatives supply 10% of their sales with renewable sources by 2018. The North Carolina Utilities Commission enforces the requirements, which serve the purpose of developing electricity procurement plans for renewable power for the state. Renewable energy may be bundled with RECs.",
